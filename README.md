The Voice Command Chatbot with ChatGPT Integration is an AI-powered conversational system that combines the intelligence of OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT with advanced NLP and speech technologies to deliver a natural, personalized, and multi-functional chatbot experience.

Unlike traditional chatbots that provide generic responses, this system adapts to user-specific lifestyle inputs such as music taste, food preferences, reading habits, humor style, travel interests, and more. This makes the conversations context-aware, relatable, and personalized.

The chatbot operates in two main modes:

General Chatbot â€“ Functions like a standard ChatGPT-powered assistant, answering queries and holding natural conversations.

Personalized Chatbot â€“ Enhances interaction by tailoring responses to individual users based on their profile inputs, such as:

Aesthetic and art preferences

Music and movie choices

Food and lifestyle habits

Humor style and social preferences

Additionally, the system integrates powerful summarization features:

Text Summarization: Condenses large text documents into concise and meaningful summaries.

Video Summarization: Extracts and processes transcripts from videos, summarizing the key information efficiently.

The chatbot also includes speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) functionalities for hands-free, voice-driven interaction, making it more accessible and user-friendly.
